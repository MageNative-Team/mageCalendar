The static variable thus shares a single memory throughout the application which makes it even easy to use nd more accessible.

Example: 

import UIKit
import mageIndicator
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        mageCalendar.calendar.setUpCalendar(view)
        mageCalendar.calendar.delegate = self
        mageCalendar.calendar.isMultipleTouchEnabled = true
        let dateFormat = DateFormatter()
        dateFormat.dateFormat = "MM-dd-yyyy"
        dateFormat.timeZone = TimeZone(abbreviation: "GMT")
        let date = dateFormat.date(from: "02-02-2012")
