# Directions To Use 

The pod mageCalendar has a file named mageCalendar with a static variable named calendar, through which the user can set up the calendar just by providing a view to the pod. The static variable thus shares a single memory throughout the application which makes it even easy to use nd more accessible.

Example:

override func viewDidLoad() { 
  super.viewDidLoad()
 mageCalendar.calendar.setUpCalendar(view)
 mageCalendar.calendar.delegate = self
 mageCalendar.calendar.isMultipleTouchEnabled = true
 let dateFormat = DateFormatter()
 dateFormat.dateFormat = "MM-dd-yyyy"
 dateFormat.timeZone = TimeZone(abbreviation: "GMT")
 let date = dateFormat.date(from: "02-02-2012")
 mageCalendar.calendar.minimumDate = date
 mageCalendar.calendar.maximuDate = Date()
 mageCalendar.calendar.selectionColor = yourFavouriteColor :)
  
}
